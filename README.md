# First Project

This is my first Spring Boot Java web application developed using the MVC architecture. 
The application is built with Thymeleaf for the view layer and does not include CSS, as it focuses primarily on backend functionality.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete posts.
- **Comments**: Ability to leave comments on posts and reply to comments.
- **Like System**: Users can like posts and comments.
- **User Profiles**: View user profiles, create your own profile, and view your profile.
- **Post Filters**: Filters on the main page to sort posts by various conditions. As well as filters in the user profile for convenient selection of the required data
- **Field Validation**: Robust field validation.
- **JavaScript**: Includes a small piece of JavaScript to enhance user experience.

## Additional Resources

- **Unlike my main project, this project does not have its own ERD and OOP diagrams, as well as a pivot table.**
