# First Project

This project is my first Spring Boot Java web application, developed using the MVC architecture. The application primarily focuses on backend functionality, with Thymeleaf used for the view layer and no CSS styling implemented.

## Project Idea

The website is inspired by the functionality of platforms like Reddit, allowing users to create posts, comment on them, and interact with others. Users can manage their profiles and filter posts by various criteria for easier navigation.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for posts, allowing users to manage content efficiently.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on posts and reply to other comments, facilitating community interaction.
- **Like System**: A simple like system is implemented for both posts and comments, allowing users to express their approval.
- **User Profiles**: Each user can create, view, and edit their profile. Other users can also view public profiles.
- **Post Filters**: Filters on the main page allow users to sort posts by different criteria (e.g., most liked, recent). Additionally, filters are available in user profiles to easily locate specific content.
- **Field Validation**: Comprehensive field validation is used to ensure that user input adheres to predefined rules, preventing errors and ensuring data integrity.

## Technology Stack

- **Version Control:** Using GitHub throughout the development of the entire project.
- **RESTful API:** Used for interaction between the frontend and backend, as well as for integration with external services.

### Backend Technologies

- **Spring Framework**
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Security
  - Thymeleaf
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Lombok**
- **Minimal JavaScript**: JavaScript is used sparingly for small enhancements to the user experience.
